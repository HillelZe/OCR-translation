"""
Runs an end-to-end test for the OCR translation app using a sample video.

This script performs the following steps:
1. Runs the main OCR application (`main.py`) with a test video file (`test_video.mp4`).
2. As the main program run in test mode the recognized word will be written to an output file.
3. Reads the output file and compares the results an expected list of results and counts matches.
4. Prints the number of successful matches to the console.
5. Deletes the `output.txt` file after the test to clean up.

Raises:
    subprocess.CalledProcessError: If running the OCR application fails.
    IOError: If reading the output file fails.
    PermissionError: If the script is denied permission to delete the output file.
